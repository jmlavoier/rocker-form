# rocker-form
> It's a tiny form example using React and Redux

### Environment
- **node**
- **yarn**
- **git**

### Installing / Getting started

I suppose that you already have **git**, **node** and **yarn** installed in your environment.

*It's fairly encouraged to use **yarn** instead of **npm** so that you can enjoy the **yarn.lock** created to make the dependencies management more reliable.* 

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:jmlavoier/rocker-form.git
$ cd rocker-form
$ yarn && yarn start
```

### Dependencies
- **react**
- **styled-components**

### Devopment tools
- **jest**
- **enzyme**

### Building

### Tests & lint

### How does it work?
